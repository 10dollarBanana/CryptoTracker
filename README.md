# CryptoTracker

I had been looking for a nice way to aggregate and track my crypto portfolios over multiple sites, but everything I found I thought charged too much or didn't offer the metrics I was looking for, so I decided to write my own. I decided to write this in python because I've wanting to learn the language for a while

## Supported Sites

### APIs:
- Binance.US
- Celsius
- Coinbase
- Coinbase Pro
- Gemini

### Upload Transaction Summaries
- BlockFi
- Coinbase Pro
- Crypto.com
- Gemini
- Gemini Earn
- Ledn: Bitcoin
- Uphold

### Manual Adding Transactions
Also supports manually adding buys, sells, trades, interest, and fees

## Issues/Comments:
- I'm sure this is pretty buggy as I only have access to my own transactions to troublshoot. If you sell or trade tokens alot I'd greatly appreciate knowing how those are coded for the various exchanges in their transaction histories. 

## Things I'd like to add:
- Abilty to sync your wallet
- Graphs

## Want to support the project?
