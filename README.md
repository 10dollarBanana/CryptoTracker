# CryptoTracker

I had been looking for a nice way to aggregate and track my crypto portfolios over multiple sites, but everything I found I thought charged too much or didn't offer the metrics I was looking for, so I decided to write my own. I decided to write this in python because I've wanting to learn the language for a while
