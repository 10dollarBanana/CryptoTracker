# PortfolioTracker

I had been looking for a nice way to aggregate and track my crypto portfolios over multiple sites, but everything I found I thought charged too much, didn't offer the metrics I was looking for, and I wasn't thrilled about the idea of putting data into what is essentially a black box.  I'm fairly new to python so I'm sure there are a better ways of doing things.

## How to:
- Getting this to install should be pretty straightforward.
1. Download entire PortfolioTracker folder
2. Open terminal
3. Within the terminal, navigate to where you have everything stored and type: `python3 main.py`
4. If you need to install a package you'll get an notification saying which package needs to be installed. To install type: `pip3 [package name]`
5. You might need to restart the app after you add your first transaction.
6. Updating the current prices is done in the File menu. 

## Issues/Comments:
- I'm sure this is pretty buggy as I only have access to my own transactions to troublshoot. If you sell or trade crypto I'd greatly appreciate knowing how those are coded for the various exchanges in their transaction histories. 

## Things I'd like to add:
- Abilty to sync wallets
- More exchanges
- Graphs

## Want to support the project?

Not expected, but certainly appreciated.
